## I’m a Data Scientist at Openreach.
I use big data to improve your phone and internet service.

I’ll be using this blog to showcase some personal projects I’m interested in, broadly in the area of data science but also anything else I find interesting.

I started my career as a research scientist in academia. If you’re interested in my previous work, I’ve moved my research site to http://physics.tjconstant.com
